Uh oh, the enemies here are quite powerful. #enter=GuidanceSoul #speaker=Guiding Soul
The Tree's deadly miasma is quite strong here as well, and it's <u>weakening us</u>.
Be careful, it looks like we'll need to <u>clear them out quickly</u> to survive.
Remember, if you right-click on my soul block, I can help clear your debuffs instead... seems like that might be useful here.
