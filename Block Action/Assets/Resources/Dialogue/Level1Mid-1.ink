Situation looks grim so I'll be quick, this is no ordinary lantern. You're going to use its light to drive out the evil from the monster. #speaker=??? #enter=GuidanceSoul
Here, you have a <u>soul inventory</u> and a <u>grid</u> to place soul blocks in.
When you hover over my block, you can see what I can do in the black box.
You're running low on health, I can help with that!
<u>Drag my soul block into the grid to activate it.</u> To use me, you'll have to end your turn by <u>clicking the lantern</u>.
